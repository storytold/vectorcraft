//! Outlines placed to a fraction of a pixel.
//!
//! A boundary loop runs along the cracks between pixels, so on its own it is a staircase that is
//! right only to half a pixel. But an anti-aliased or slightly blurred image says where the edge
//! really is: the pixels beside it are part one colour and part the other. Each crack between an
//! inside and an outside pixel is moved along its normal by what the four pixels across it say (see
//! [`Crack`]), which gives one point per crack; a corner of the loop that is a true corner of the
//! shape (not a step of a staircase) is kept, moved with the two edges that meet there. The same
//! crack gives the same point from either side, so two regions that touch get the same points along
//! their shared edge.
//!
//! An image with hard edges (a GIF, a 1-bit scan) says nothing more than the cracks do: every crack
//! moves by the same amount. There the staircase is read the classic way: a one-pixel step between
//! two runs is a point of a sloped edge (its middle is on the edge, the corners beside it are not).
//! A staircase of longer steps is read the same way where a smooth area was split into bands (see
//! [`outline`]).
