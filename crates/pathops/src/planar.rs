//! Live Paint planar maps: the faces and edges a set of paths divides the plane into.
//!
//! Unlike Pathfinder [`regions`](crate::regions), which splits the *filled areas* of closed shapes,
//! every path here is an edge, open ones included: three crossing lines enclose a triangle, a line
//! across a rectangle splits it in two, and an area enclosed by paths is a face whether or not
//! anything fills it.
//!
//! The sweep (`linesweeper`) only takes closed paths, so an open path goes in traced there and
//! back. Its two passes would cancel out as winding numbers, so the sweep counts boundary crossings
//! instead ([`Crossings`]), which never cancel. Faces are then walked on the planar graph of the
//! sweep's output segments; which inputs an edge came from and which fills cover a face are found
//! geometrically (the sweep's winding numbers can't be trusted once open paths and coincident
//! edges are in).
//!
//! The sweep runs in a sheared frame ([`SHEAR`]): it merges the two passes of a *horizontal* open
//! path as if they cancelled out, and in the sheared frame no edge drawn at a common angle (0°,
//! 45°, 90°…) is horizontal. The shear is by a power of two, so it maps typical coordinates
//! exactly and keeps exact coincidences (a corner on another shape's edge) exact.
