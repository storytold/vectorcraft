//! Geometry for VectorCraft's built-in add-ons, one module per add-on, with the kernels they share.
//!
//! - [`keep_shape`]: remove anchors while refitting their neighbours' handles, so the outline keeps
//!   its shape within a tolerance (shared by every add-on that takes anchors away).
//! - [`cleanup`]: Artwork Cleanup's path repairs (collinear, duplicate and near anchors, tiny
//!   handles, nearly closed paths) and Rejoin Path Pieces.
//! - [`pathtools`]: Path Precision Tools' anchor edits, path readouts, extending open paths and
//!   finding where paths cross.
//! - [`segment_reshape`]: bending a segment by dragging a point on it (shared by the tools that
//!   reshape segments directly).
//! - [`pen`]: the Smart Pen's straight and curved segments and its point edits.
