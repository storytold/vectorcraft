//! Stencil Bridges: the art a stencil is cut from, with strips cut out of it so that every island
//! of the stencil sheet stays attached.
//!
//! The art is the area the stencil's holes take. Each bounded area outside the art (the inside of
//! an O, any hole of a shape) is an island of the sheet. A bridge is a straight strip of a set
//! width cut out of the art, from an island across the art to the sheet beyond it, or to another
//! island. The bridges are picked as a spanning tree over the islands and the sheet (shortest
//! crossings first), so every island that has room for one is joined to the sheet, then each
//! island gets more bridges, spread around it, up to the number asked for.
//!
//! Crossings are measured along straight lines in one direction at a time (vertical, horizontal,
//! or every 15 degrees for the shortest crossing), spaced half a bridge width apart.
