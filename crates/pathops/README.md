# vectorcraft-pathops

Path operations for Vector W3K2: booleans, the Pathfinder panel, Shape Builder regions, Live Paint planar maps, offset path, outline stroke, simplify and the other Object → Path commands. Everything takes and returns `vectorcraft_geom::PathData`.

## Booleans (curve-preserving)

```rust
pub enum BoolOp { Union, Intersect, Difference, Xor }
pub fn boolean(a: &PathData, a_rule: FillRule, b: &PathData, b_rule: FillRule, op: BoolOp) -> PathData;
pub fn try_boolean(.., precision: f64) -> Result<PathData, PathOpsError>; // errors on NaN/inf
pub fn boolean_n(paths: &[(&PathData, FillRule)], pred: impl Fn(&[bool]) -> bool) -> PathData;
pub fn unite_all(paths: &[(&PathData, FillRule)]) -> PathData;   // fast many-shape union
pub fn normalize(path: &PathData, rule: FillRule) -> PathData;   // resolve self-overlaps
pub fn area(path: &PathData, rule: FillRule) -> f64;             // exact filled area
```

The engine is `linesweeper` (a robust sweep line that works directly on cubic Béziers, so there's no polygon flattening). The sweep splits curves at intersections and y-extrema. Afterwards:

- pieces that lie on one input cubic are rebuilt exactly as a single sub-curve of that cubic;
- other smooth joints (for example, in stroker output) are refitted by least squares within `DEFAULT_PRECISION` (0.01 pt);
- collinear line pieces are merged;
- the inputs' own anchors are always kept;
- slivers narrower than the precision are dropped.

Output contours are simple and consistently oriented: outer contours and holes wind in opposite directions, so the result fills the same under either fill rule. Open subpaths are closed implicitly because they're treated as filled.

## Pathfinder / Shape Builder

```rust
pub struct Shape { pub path: PathData, pub rule: FillRule, pub key: u64 } // key = paint identity
pub enum PathfinderOp { Unite, MinusFront, Intersect, Exclude, Divide, Trim, Merge, Crop, Outline, MinusBack }
pub fn pathfinder(op: PathfinderOp, shapes: &[Shape] /* back → front */) -> Vec<Shape>;

pub struct Region { pub path: PathData, pub sources: Vec<usize> }
pub fn regions(shapes: &[Shape]) -> Vec<Region>;            // all faces of the arrangement
pub fn region_at(shapes: &[Shape], p: Point) -> Option<Region>;
pub fn merge_regions(regions: &[&Region]) -> PathData;      // Shape Builder merge = union
```

Each result takes its key as follows:

| Operation | Result |
|---|---|
| Unite, Intersect, Exclude, Minus Back | Takes the front-most key |
| Minus Front | Takes the back-most key |
| Divide | One shape per face, keyed by the front-most shape that covers the face |
| Trim | One shape for each object that is still visible |
| Merge | Joins touching visible parts that share a key; each connected component becomes one shape |
| Crop | Keeps the visible parts of the lower objects inside the front-most object |
| Outline | Returns open edge paths, split at every junction; coincident edges are de-duplicated, and each keeps the front-most key |

## Live Paint

```rust
pub fn live_paint(shapes: &[Shape] /* back → front */) -> (Vec<Region>, Vec<Shape>); // (faces, edges)
pub fn interior_point(path: &PathData) -> Option<Point>;
```

Unlike `regions`, which splits the filled areas of closed shapes, `live_paint` treats every path as an edge, open paths included. Three crossing lines enclose a triangle, a line across a rectangle splits it in two, and an area enclosed by paths becomes a face even when nothing fills it. Each face lists the inputs whose fill covers it; the list is empty for an area that is only enclosed by paths. Each edge is a piece of a path, split wherever another path meets it, and keeps the key of the front-most input it lies on.

## Offset / stroke

```rust
pub use kurbo::{Cap, Join};
pub fn offset_path(path: &PathData, delta: f64, join: Join, miter_limit: f64) -> PathData; // delta < 0 insets
pub fn outline_stroke(path: &PathData, width: f64, cap: Cap, join: Join, miter_limit: f64) -> PathData;
```

`outline_stroke` passes the path to `kurbo::stroke` and then normalizes the result, which removes the overlaps at joins. `offset_path` computes `fill ∪ stroke(2|d|)` for a positive offset and `fill − stroke(2|d|)` for a negative one.

## Path editing

```rust
pub fn simplify(path: &PathData, tolerance: f64) -> PathData;
pub fn simplify_with(path: &PathData, opts: &SimplifyOptions) -> PathData; // tolerance, corner_angle_deg, straight_lines
pub fn smooth(path: &PathData, amount: f64) -> PathData;
pub fn remove_redundant_points(path: &PathData, tolerance: f64) -> PathData;
pub fn add_anchor_points(path: &PathData) -> PathData;
pub fn average(path: &PathData, selection: &[(usize, usize)], axis: AverageAxis) -> PathData;
pub fn join(paths: &[PathData], tolerance: f64) -> PathData;
pub fn split_into_grid(rect: Rect, rows: usize, cols: usize, gutter: f64) -> Vec<PathData>;
```

`simplify` fits least-squares cubics with fixed end tangents, then reparameterizes with Newton steps and splits at the point of worst error. Any anchor that turns more than the corner threshold (30° by default) stays a corner.

## Caveats

- linesweeper is still in beta. When two identical curves overlap, the sweep can leave a tiny lens between them; the sliver filter removes it.
- The Outline op finds split points by snapping to arrangement junctions with a small tolerance.
- The quality of offsets depends on kurbo's parallel-curve stroker. Its output is refitted, so offset results have more anchors than boolean results.
